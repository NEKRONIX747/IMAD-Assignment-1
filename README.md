IMAD assignment 1 
My Report
This is where I will be doing my report on how my app runs and performs and where I will be explaining why we use github and github actions and the use of an yml file. 
My apps performance
My app was running as expected, there were no syntax errors or logical process errors. The app performed its tasks of displaying a meal suggestion that was relevant to the time of day that was input. The reset button worked as it should as when you hit reset it cleared all prompts from the text box. To the best of my knowledge there was no redundant code in my app, and it had no errors. Below I will include a screenshot of my code. My code is also not entirely my own as I drew inspiration as well as some code from Zahra Bulbulia my lecturer and the link to her repository will be in the bibliography section of my report.

This is the entirety of my code used and as shown the code has no syntax errors or redundant code. Below I will include multiple screenshots of how the app looks both clear and with an input from the user as well as the else statement in use.

Github
Why do we use Github? Well, we use github to not only share our code with our lecturers, but it is also a major platform for like-minded people and can be utilized to streamline the process in the classroom and workspace as you can manage many different projects through the repository system as well as getting valuable input from peers and like-minded individuals. (Zagalsky, Feliciano, Storey, Zhao, Wang. 2015)

Github Actions
Why do we use something like github actions? We use github actions or GHA as it is referred to in many studies I have read to allow for more seamless workflow. Another reason why we use GHA is for automated testing of our code wich allows peers and lecturers a like to test and make sure our code is efficient and flawless with no room for error. (Kinsman, Wessel, Gerosa, Treude. 2021)
YML Files
Why do we use an yml file in github? The yml file is there to help them with things like testing and building as well as deploying the code itself. This is imperative to the process as it allows streamlining of the process. (Wang. 2022)
